SpringJWTauthentication

# Simple Spring Boot application with JWT authentication. 
- Has an api with get requests and an api with post requests (for registration and login) without need of authorization.
- Has a secured api on which the client has to send the received JWT token via Header to be authorized.
- future features implementations: use roles to authenticate.
